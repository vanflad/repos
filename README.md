Hi I'm Yeonuk. Nice to meet you

adding new stuff here

always commit THEN push to Github for it to work!

knitter does .Rmd -> .md -> .html

'ml' stands for mark up language

output: pdf_document is useful in R markdown

command-option-i to create R code chunk in R markdown

command enter to execute a line
or command option c to execute a whole chunk
or command option n to execute chunk and move to next
R markdown shortcut cheat sheet to find these

This is my remote conflict
